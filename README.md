# Machine Learning Tools Lab

This repository contains my work for the Machine Learning Tools Laboratory.  
The main purpose of this lab is to understand how machine learning tools and libraries work in a practical way, rather than just learning theory.

In this lab, I am learning how to use tools like TensorFlow.js and GitHub to write, run, and observe machine learning related programs using simple examples. Each practical focuses on understanding the basics step by step, starting from setup and verification to applying basic operations.

I have organized this repository in a folder-wise manner so that each experiment is easy to access and understand. Every practical has its own folder with the corresponding code and output, making it convenient for evaluation and revision.

This lab helps me build confidence in using machine learning tools, understanding data operations using tensors, and gaining hands-on experience with real development environments.


## How to View the Output

1. Open the required folder.
2. Open the `index.html` file or use the GitHub Pages link.
3. Press **F12** and check the **Console** tab to view the output.
